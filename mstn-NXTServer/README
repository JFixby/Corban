Requirements
=============

LeJOS NXJ 0.85
Java 1.4 or later
Ant
(better) Eclipse (I use elios, but older version should be ok) 

In what follows we assume the reader has a bit of familiarity with LeJOS and Lego NXT technologies.

The code has been tested on Snow Leopard.


Preliminary steps
=================

Follow the instructions for preparing LeJOS on your system
http://lejos.sourceforge.net/nxt/nxj/tutorial/Preliminaries/GettingStarted.htm

Configuration
==============

Modify samples.properties (yes, I have to find a better name) in order to reflect the configuration of your system.
In particular, you have to change these variables
nxj.home = home directory for your LeJOS
nxt.sharedlib.jar = absolute path to the NXTSharedLib.jar file in the lib directory (for some reason I does not work with relative paths)

Compile and running the server
===============================

Run ant file samplebuild.xml to compile, link, upload and run NXTServer.
You must have NXT usb plugged and switched on.
If everything is ok, you will see "waiting for client" on the LCD screen of your NXT.
If you want to play with the robot, you can use a Java client we build (see NXTClient).


Known Issues
=============

*Snow Leopard* uses 64-bit JVM. LeJOS works with 32-bit JVM. In order to force the use of 32-bit JVM on Snow Leopard you have to invoke the interpreter as java -d32...
We patched samplebuild.xml to work with 32-bit.
